## 2. Abstract
Provide a concise summary (150–250 words) describing:
- The problem you are addressing:
-   We want to help treat and care for your cat more consistently.
-   The problem we have found is that most cats are not cared for enough
-   as owners are either under the misconception that cats are low maintenance or are away for long periods of time.
-   Cats, therefore, become depressed and it's difficult for owners to see changes in their cats health, especially if the changes are small and
-   would only be noticed if they were around their cat more often.
- Brief description about your proposed project:
-   We are here to make an all-intelligent home for the owners to get for their cats and themselves.
-   The cat home, Catopia, will allow the owner to monitor and care for their cat.
-   Catopia will track and store data each day from each of the many sensors, like water intake, food intake, temperature and humidity tracker,
-   camera's, and mic.
-   
- Key technologies involved:
-   We will have a lot of sensors to track your cats health and use data that data to display on the app.
-   The cat house will have motors, bluetooth, and audio/visual modules to interact with your cat through the app as well. 
- Expected outcomes or impact:
-   We think the impact of this project will help lead to more awareness for cat health and making sure they are being properly cared for.
-   A great outcome that we see when you can monitor and play with your cat more is that the cat will be and stay healthy.
